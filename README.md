I decided to work independently on my own without a partner and developed a project that I named Ecommerce. I structured the project into three main parts. The first part is the frontend, which includes all the user interface and display components. It functions as a complete ecommerce website where products are showcased for sale. These products are retrieved from another directory that represents the backend part of the application.

The entire workflow is managed through an admin panel, which allows control over the website's content and data. I also implemented essential user features such as login, signup, and order placement, enabling users to create accounts and make purchases on the platform.

For the backend, I used technologies such as Express.js, MongoDB Atlas, Mongoose, and Nodemon, along with several other useful commands and tools to ensure smooth development and functionality. On the frontend, I used React.js to build a dynamic and responsive user interface, while Express handled the backend operations and API management.
